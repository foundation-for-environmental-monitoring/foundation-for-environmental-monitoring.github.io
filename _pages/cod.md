## Principle
COD is a titration test. COD stands for Chemical Oxygen Demand. It is a method for assessing water pollution post-treatment, with higher values indicating increased organic pollution. 

Unlike Biological Oxygen Demand, COD is suitable for toxic water and non-biodegradable organic matter in effluent treatment plants. COD determination is quicker than  BOD testing, offering efficient analysis of chemically digestible matter in water samples.

## Calibration
No calibration is required for this test.

## Test
This test uses the COD reagents.

* Take 10 ml of the water sample into a round bottom reflex flask.
* Add some glass beads to prevent the solution from bumping into the flask while heating.
* Add 1 ml of Reagent A to the flask and mix by swirling the flask.
* Add 5 ml of Reagent B to the flask.
* Now slowly and carefully add 15 ml of Reagent C.
* Connect the reflex condenser and digest the contents using a hot plate for 2 hours.
* After digestion, cool the flask and rinse the condenser with 25 ml of distilled water collecting in the same flask.
* Add 2-4 drops of Reagent D to the flask and titrate with the titrant to the endpoint.
* From the home screen choose `Titration Test` > `Water` > `Dissolved Oxygen` and enter the titration result. 
* This should give you the result in mg/L.
