## Principle
Total Alkalinity is a titration test.

## Calibration
No calibration is needed for this test

## Test

Determination of P - Alkalinity in water sample
* Take 10 ml of water sample in a glass test chamber and add 3 drops of phenolphthalein
Indicator in it.
* If pink color appears, titrate it with 0.02N Sulphuric acid and note down number of drops
or ml added (V1)

Determination of Total - Alkalinity in water sample
* To the same test chamber add 3 drops of BM reagent then blue color will appear.
* Titrate it with 0.04 N sulphuric acid till reddish color will appear
* Note down number of drops or ml added (V2)
* Open the ffem app and enter the number of drops to get the final reading.
