## Principle
Nitrite is a colorimeteric test. This test uses a N-(1-napthyl)-ethyelnediamine reagent.

Nitrite is not listed as a water quality parameter by Indian Drinking Water standards.

## Calibration
To prepare calibration standards, take 5 ml of distilled water. Depending on if you chose minimal or full calibration, prepare standards as below.

**Full Calibration**

| Standard | Drops |
| --- | --- |
| 0 mg/l | 0 |
| 0.05 mg/l | 1 |
| 0.1 mg/l | 2 |
| 0.2 mg/l | 4 |
| 0.3 mg/l | 6 |
| 0.4 mg/l | 8 |

**Minimal Calibration**

| Standard | Drops |
| --- | --- |
| 0 mg/l | 0 |
| 0.05 mg/l | 1 |
| 0.3 mg/l | 6 |

Take 5 ml of the 0 mg/l Nitrite standard, and add 5 drops of the Nitrite Reagent and shake well.

* Take the resulting coloured solution and fill it into the white cuvette provided.
* Place the cuvette under the light box and turn it on. 
* Place the phone over the stand.
* Go to `Settings` > `Colorimetric Test` > `Calibrate` and choose `Nitrite`.
* Select the calibration point, 0 mg/l in this case.
* Click on `Start Camera`.
* Position the cuvette so that the middle, most uniformly lit portion is within the circle.
* Select `Analyze`.
* You should have your first calibration point. Repeat similarly with the other calibration points.

## Test
This test uses the Nitrite Reagent.

* Collect 5 ml of sample water, add 5 drops of the Nitrite Reagent, and place in the white cuvette.
* Place the cuvette under the light box and turn it on.
* Place the phone over the stand.
* From the home screen choose `Colorimetric Test` > `Water` > `Nitrite`.
* Choose `No Dilution` if this is the first test, you might have to dilute the sample and retry later if you get an error.
* Click on `Start Camera`.
* Position the cuvette so that the middle, most uniformly lit portion is within the circle.
* Select `Analyze`.
* After some time, the app will display a result.
