### Legal Structure

ffem is a nonprofit ([section 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-profit_laws_of_India#Section-8_Company)) company based in Bangalore, Karnataka, India.

### Philosophy

ffem works on issues that have an impact on the lives of millions, but are overlooked by market forces. All the work ffem does is [open source](http://github.com/foundation-for-environmental-monitoring) (including hardware, where developed in house). Currently, ffem's approach is to develop [products]({{ site.url }}/products/) designed for easy use to help address these issues.

### Areas of work

ffem currently works on water and soil.

### People

ffem is comprised of a team of researchers, product developers, and software developers.

### History

An early version of the product later called Caddisfly was demonstrated at a Water Hackathon in 2011. In 2012, [Ternup Research Labs, LLP](http://ternup.com), was started with the goal of developing and commercializing this product as a low cost, open source, and easy to use water quality monitoring kit. In 2014, the team merged with [Akvo](http://akvo.org), a Netherlands based non profit. In 2017, ffem was [spun off as an independent entity](https://akvo.org/blog/akvo-spins-off-environmental-sensor-organisation-ffem/). The product continues to be open source, though there are different roadmaps with both organizations. The name Caddisfly has been licensed to ffem, while the product is jointly maintained.

### Intellectual Property Policy

Any project or product initiated or owned by ffem is open source. However while collaborating, partners' intellectual property will be respected.
