## Principle
Potassium is a colorimeteric test. 

The Indian Standard for drinking water does not specify an acceptable limit of potassium in water. However, according to the WHO, drinking water should have a potassium level below 12 mg/l.

## Calibration
To prepare calibration standards, take 5 ml of distilled water. Depending on if you chose minimal or full calibration, prepare standards as below.

**Full Calibration**

| Standard | Drops |
| --- | --- |
| 0 mg/l | 0 |
| 10 mg/l | 10 |
| 20 mg/l | 20 |
| 30 mg/l | 30 |

**Minimal Calibration**

| Standard | Drops |
| --- | --- |
| 0 mg/l | 0 |
| 10 mg/l | 10 |
| 30 mg/l | 30 |

Take 5 ml of the 0 mg/l Potassium standard, dilute it to 10 ml with distilled water. Add 5 drops of Reagent A and mix well. Add 10 drops of Reagent B and mix well. 

* Take the resulting coloured solution and fill it into the white cuvette provided.
* Place the cuvette under the light box and turn it on.
* Place the phone over the stand.
* Go to `Settings` > `Colorimetric Test` > `Calibrate` and choose `Potassium`.
* Select the calibration point, 0 mg/l in this case.
* Click on `Start Camera`.
* Position the cuvette so that the middle, most uniformly lit portion is within the circle.
* Select `Analyze`.
* You should have your first calibration point. Repeat similarly with the other calibration points. 

## Test
This test uses the Potassium reagents.

* Collect 5 ml of sample water, add 5 drops of Reagent A and 10 drops of Reagent B and shake for 5 seconds to mix well. Place the solution in the white cuvette.
* Place the cuvette under the lightbox and turn it on.
* Place the phone over the stand.
* From the home screen choose `Colorimetric Test` > `Water` > `Potassium`.
* Choose `No Dilution` if this is the first test, you might have to dilute the sample and retry later if you get an error.
* Click on `Start Camera`.
* Position the cuvette so that the middle, most uniformly lit portion is within the circle.
* Select `Analyze`.
* After some time, the app will display a result.
