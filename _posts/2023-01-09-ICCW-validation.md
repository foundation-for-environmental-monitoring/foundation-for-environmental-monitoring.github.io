Testing and validation by a trusted third party are crucial in establishing a product. Field test kits, along with laboratories and IoT devices are important components in the overall water sector infrastructure, and as such need to be vetted and verified.

The [International Centre for Clean Water (ICCW)](https://iccw.world/), an IIT Madras initiative, has verified our water testing method for 17 parameters. The process was to test water samples with our kit and against the applicable standard test checking if they were within an acceptable margin. The kits were also tested for repeatability.

The parameters thus verified are pH, Turbidity, DO, Total Hardness, Total Alkalinity, Sulphate, Iron, Chloride, Nitrate, Fluoride, Manganese, Free residual Chlorine, Zinc, Boron, Chromium, Copper, and Zinc.

While cementing the confidence we have in our product, we hope that this validation would help build trust.

### Disclaimers
ffem’s tests are no substitute for laboratory tests. Field tests have their place as do tests with standard equipment.

The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) does not yet have a certification process for water quality test kits.
