## Principle
The pH value of the soil, whether the soil is acidic or basic. 

## Calibration
pH standards based on buffer solutions should be supplied to you. You shoule have standards of pH 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.

Take 5 ml of the pH standard, say 4, and add 1 drop of the pH indicator.

* Take the resulting coloured solution and fill it into the white cuvette provided.
* Place the cuvette under the light stand and turn it on.
* Place the phone over the stand
* Go to `Settings` > `Colorimetric Test` > `Calibrate` and choose `pH`
* Select the calibration point, 4 in this case
* Click on `Start Camera`
* Position the cuvette so that the middle, most uniformly lit portion is within the circle.
* Select `Analyze`
* You should have your first calibration point. Repeat similarly with the other calibration points.

## Extraction
* Take 5 ml of soil in the measuring spoon.
* Fill 25 ml of distilled water in the measuring tube, and add the 5 ml of soil.
* Close the tube, shake well and leave to settle.
* Filter out the top clear layer of extracted solution


## Test
This test uses the pH indicator.

* Collect 5 ml of extracted solution, add 1 drop of pH indicator and place in the white cuvette.
* Place the cuvette under the light stand and turn it on.
* Place the phone over the stand
* From the home screen choose `Colorimetric Test` > `Soil` > `pH`
* Choose `No Dilution` if this is the first test, you might have to dilute the sample and retry later if you get an error.
* Click on `Start Camera`
* Position the cuvette so that the middle, most uniformly lit portion is within the circle.
* Select `Analyze`
* After some time, the app will display a result.
