## Doing one thing
ffem match does one thing that is help you conduct colorimetric or titration tests. The focus will remain on providing the most accurate results for these tests. ffem match will leave data collection and other aspects to other apps.

## Multiple apps
For various reasons, ffem had released multiple apps to cater to all use cases. We had ffem soil, ffem water, ffem lite, and ffem collect all doing similar things, and leading to confusion among our users. We just delisted all these apps from the play store.

## Open Source
At this time, ffem match is an exact fork of [ffem lite](https://github.com/foundation-for-environmental-monitoring/ffem-lite). ffem lite will continue to remain open source. At any time, you should be able to perform any colorimetric or titration test using ffem lite. 

ffem match will use the same core of ffem lite, but will diverge in adding features for usability and very specific tests.

Any changes in the color matching systems or any new class of tests released will be added to ffem lite.

## Existing users
If you are an existing user of ffem's tests and have a need for any of the older, delisted apps, [do get in touch](mailto:info@ffem.io).
