## Principle
The Residual Chlorine test is a colorimetric test, but is a little different from the other colorimetric tests here. We use a colour card rather than standard solutions. This test has a range of 0 to 3 mg/l 

## Calibration
You do not need to make calibration standards for this test, just use distilled water for calibration.

* Take 5ml distilled water in a 15 ml measuring tube.
* Add 3 drops of free chlorine reagent in it and mix well.
* Pour 5 ml of the solution into the cuvette.
* Place the cuvette into the holder in the box
* On the next page click on `Calibrate`
* Align the colour card to the image displayed, the instructions on the screen would help, and press `Start`.
* Click on `Start Timer` and wait the required amount of time for the reaction to take place.
* The camera immediately opens up once the specific time is up.
* Point your phone to get a uniform colour of colour solution and keep the phone on a light box to capture images of solution and calibrate.
* In case of an error message while calibrating, re-calibrate.
* On successful scanning, you will be shown the calibrated point and the colour shift.
* Press `Accept`.
* Your phone is now calibrated. You can now begin testing samples.

 Note: Calibration needs to be done only once for every parameter. The `Calibrate` option changes to `Re-calibrate` when calibration is complete. There is no need for recalibration before testing every sample.

## Test
* Measure out 5 ml of your sample in a 15 ml measuring tube.
* Add 3 drops of Free chlorine reagent.
* Shake well to ensure proper mixing of reagents
* Pour 5 ml of the solution into the testing chamber.
* Place the testing chamber into the holder in the box.
* Put a Residual Chlorine colour card on the test chamber.
* Click on `Start Test`.
* Read the instructions on the screen and press `Start`.
* The camera immediately opens up once the specific time is up.
* Point your phone to align the green coloured grid on the screen with your colour card setup
* Your result will be displayed on the screen.
