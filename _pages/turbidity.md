## Principle
Turbidity, measured in NTU is a colorimetric test with no reagents. Turbidity is a measure of how clear water is. Distilled water should have turbidity of 0 NTU.

The Indian Standard for drinking water holds that the acceptable limit is 1 NTU, but in the absence of any other toxic substances or alternate source, this is relaxable upto 5 NTU.

## Calibration
To prepare calibration standards, take 10 ml of distilled water. Depending on if you chose minimal or full calibration, prepare standards as below.

**Full Calibration**

| Standard | Drops |
| --- | --- |
| 0 NTU | 0 |
| 10 NTU | 10 |
| 20 NTU | 20 |
| 30 NTU | 30 |

**Minimal Calibration**

| Standard | Drops |
| --- | --- |
| 0 NTU | 0 |
| 10 NTU | 10 |
| 30 NTU | 30 |

You do not need to add any reagent for this test. **Shake the standard solutions dropper bottle thoroughly**.

* Take the 0 standard and fill it into the glass cuvette provided. Place the glass cuvette inside the blue cuvette.
* Place the cuvette under the light stand.
* Clip on the ring light over your phone and turn it on to maximum brightness
* Place the phone over the stand
* Go to `Settings` > `Colorimetric Test` > `Calibrate` and choose `Turbidity`
* Select the calibration point, 0.00 NTU in this case
* Click on `Start Camera`
* Position the cuvette so that the middle, most uniformly lit portion is within the circle.
* Select `Analyze`
* You should have your first calibration point. Repeat similarly with the other calibration points.

## Test
This test does not require a reagent.

* Collect 10 ml of sample water and place in glass cuvette and in turn inside the blue cuvette.
* Place the cuvette under the light stand.
* Clip on the ring light over your phone and turn it on to maximum brightness
* Place the phone over the stand
* From the home screen choose `Colorimetric Test` > `Water` > `Turbidity`
* Choose `No Dilution` if this is the first test, you might have to dilute the sample and retry later if you get an error.
* Click on `Start Camera`
* Position the cuvette so that the middle, most uniformly lit portion is within the circle.
* Select `Analyze`
* After some time, the app will display a result.
