## Principle
Water colour is measured in Hazen Units, and is a measure of the cleanness of the water source. This is a colorimetric test.

## Calibration
To prepare calibration standards, take 5 ml of distilled water. Depending on if you chose minimal or full calibration, prepare standards as below.

| Standard | Drops |
| --- | --- |
| 0 HU | 0 |
| 25 HU | 5 |
| 50 HU | 10 |
| 100 HU | 20 |

You do not need to add any reagent for this test.

* Take the 0 standard and fill it into the cuvette.
* Place the cuvette under the light stand.
* Clip on the ring light over your phone and turn it on to maximum brightness
* Place the phone over the stand
* Go to `Settings` > `Colorimetric Test` > `Calibrate` and choose `Hazen Units`
* Select the calibration point, 0.00 HU in this case
* Click on `Start Camera`
* Position the cuvette so that the middle, most uniformly lit portion is within the circle.
* Select `Analyze`
* You should have your first calibration point. Repeat similarly with the other calibration points.

## Test
This test does not require a reagent.

* Collect 5 ml of sample water and place in cuvette
* Place the cuvette under the light stand.
* Clip on the ring light over your phone and turn it on to maximum brightness
* Place the phone over the stand
* From the home screen choose `Colorimetric Test` > `Water` > `Hazen Units`
* Choose `No Dilution` if this is the first test, you might have to dilute the sample and retry later if you get an error.
* Click on `Start Camera`
* Position the cuvette so that the middle, most uniformly lit portion is within the circle.
* Select `Analyze`
* After some time, the app will display a result.
