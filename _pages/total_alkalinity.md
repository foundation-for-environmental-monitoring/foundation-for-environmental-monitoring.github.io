## Principle
Total Alkalinity is a titration test.

The Indian Standard for drinking water holds that the acceptable limit is 200 mg/l, but in the absence of any other toxic substances or alternate source, this is relaxable upto 600 mg/l.

## Calibration
No calibration is needed for this test.

## Test
Total Alkalinity is the sum of P and T Alkalinity.

 **P - Alkalinity**
* Take 10 ml of sample in a measuring tube, and add 3 drops of P-Alkalinity Reagent A.
* If the solution turns pink, titrate it with P-Alkalinity Titrant by adding drops and keeping count of the number of drops till the colour changes from pink to colourless.
* If the solution does not turn pink P-Alkalinty is 0.
* On the app, go to `Titration Test` > `Total Alkalinity` and enter the number of drops in the first textfield.
* This should give you the result in mg/l.


**T - Alkalinity**
* To the same measuring tube add 3 drops of T-Alkalinity Reagent, The colour should change to blue.
* Titrate it with T-Alkalinity Titrant till turns reddish by adding it dropwise. Keep count of the number of drops.
* On the app, go to `Titration Test` > `Total Alkalinity` and enter the number of drops in the second textfield.
* This should give you the result in mg/l.
