## Principle
Calcium and Magensium are titration tests.

## Extraction
Prepare an extraction solution by dissolving 1 teaspoon of table salt to 1 liter of water. Distilled water or deionized water would be ideal, but if you do not have access to it, then use tap water, RO Filtered water, or bottled water. Avoid using water from stagnant water bodies or groundwater. For the salt, do not use low sodium salt, rock salt, pink salt, black salt, or any such variant - simple store bought table salt should suffice.

## Calibration
No calibration is needed for this test

## Test
For Calcium, take 2 ml of extraction solution. Add 40 drops of Reagent A, and 1 spoon of Reagent B. Mix well. Now add the titrant drop by drop, shaking each time, till the pink turns to purple. Keep track of the drops you are adding.

For Magnesium, take 2 ml of extraction solution. Add 40 drops of Reagent A, and 2 drops of Reagent B. Mix well. Now add the titrant drop by drop, shaking each time, till the red turns to blue. Keep track of the drops you are adding.

Go to `Titration Tests` and then `Calcium and Magnesiuim` under `Soil`. Enter the number of drops of titrant to obtain the values of Available Calcium and Magnesium.
