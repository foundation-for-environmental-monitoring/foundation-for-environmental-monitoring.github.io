## Before you start
Test kits from ffem and Hasiru Dala Innovations use chemicals as reagents. It is important that you exercise proper precautions while using and storing the kits.

* Store in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.
* Keep away from children and animals
* Do not allow the chemicals to come in contact with your skin or eyes. Recommended that you use appropriate [gloves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_glove).
* Dispose used reagent in the disposal bottle provided. This disposal bottle contains activated charcoal. Dry it out and then dispose the solid waste in your local chemical / hazardous waste process.

The tests work only on Android phones with a camera of 8MP and over.

## Unboxing
Typically a test kit should comprose

* Stand
* Ring light
* Measuring tubes
* Calibration standards
* Reagents
* TDS / EC meter if your order included it

You can download the app from the Google Play Store here: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.ffem.lite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.ffem.lite)

## Using the kit
The ring light supplied comes with a battery and a USB cable. Ensure the ring light is fully charged before using it. Clip it onto your phone so that the light encircles the camera. Pressing the light switch once turns it on to its lowest brightness, a second press moves it to the next brightness, and the third makes it brightest. A fourth press of the button will turn off the light. Put on the ring light at its brightest.

The place the stand over the cuvette, most tests use the white cuvette. The ring light over the phone should fit into the light stand.

## Calibration
Before you can test you should calibrate colorimetric tests on your phone, and in order to do so you need to make standard solutions. The dropper bottles with the standard solutions are labelled. The quantity of deionised / distilled water and the number of drops for each parameter are below.

| Parameter | Standard | DI Water | Drops |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Colour | 0 HU | 5ml | 0 |
| Colour | 5 HU | 5ml | 5 |
| Colour | 15 HU | 5ml | 5 |
| Turbidity | 0 NTU | 15ml | 0 |
| Turbidity | 1 NTU | 15ml | 5 |
| Turbidity | 5 NTU | 15ml | 5 |
| Fluoride | 0 mg/l | 5ml | 0 |
| Fluoride | 0.5 mg/l | 5ml | 5 |
| Fluoride | 1 mg/l | 5ml | 10 |
| Fluoride | 1.5 mg/l | 5ml | 15 |
| Fluoride | 2 mg/l | 5ml | 20 |
| Nitrate | 0 mg/l | 5ml | 0 |
| Nitrate | 10 mg/l | 5ml | 5 |
| Nitrate | 25 mg/l | 5ml | 10 |
| Nitrate | 50 mg/l | 5ml | 15 |
| Nitrate | 75 mg/l | 5ml | 20 |
| pH | 4 | 5ml | 5ml |
| pH | 5 | 5ml | 5ml |
| pH | 6 | 5ml | 5ml |
| pH | 7 | 5ml | 5ml |
| pH | 8 | 5ml | 5ml |
| pH | 9 | 5ml | 5ml |
| pH | 10 | 5ml | 5ml |
| Iron | 0 mg/l | 5ml | 0 |
| Iron | 0.5 mg/l  | 5ml | 5 |
| Iron | 1 mg/l  | 5ml | 10 |
| Iron | 1.5 mg/l  | 5ml | 15 |
| Iron | 2 mg/l  | 5ml | 20 |

Go to Settings > Calibrate > Calibrate Using a Standard.

Select the parameter you want to calibrate, make the standards, and add reagent as mentioned against the parameter in the section on testing.

Calibrate for each standard, and then you are ready to begin testing.

## Testing

#### Colorimetric tests

Parameters and quantity of reagent are mentioned below.

| Parameter | Sample | Reagent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Colour | 5 ml | No Reagent |
| Turbidity | 15 ml | No Reagent |
| Fluoride | 5 ml | 5 drops |
| Nitrate | 5 ml | 1 pack of Reagent A, 1 pack of Reagent B |
| pH | 5ml | 1 drop |
| Iron | 5 ml | 1 drop of Reagent A, 5 drops of Reagent B |

On the home screen select Colorimetric Test and the choose the parameter. Add reagent to the sample as specified above. Pour the reagent into the cuvette and place under the stand. Click on No Dilution, and then Start Camera. Position the cuvette so that it is directly below and centered on the yellow circle as shown below.

Click on Analyse, and the camera will start. If all goes well you should see a result.

#### Titration tests

*Total Alkalinity*

Determination of P - Alkalinity in water sample
1. Take 10 ml of water sample in a glass test chamber and add 3 drops of phenolphthalein
Indicator in it.
2. If pink color appears, titrate it with 0.02N Sulphuric acid and note down number of drops
or ml added (V1)
Determination of Total - Alkalinity in water sample
1. To the same test chamber add 3 drops of BM reagent then blue color will appear.
2. Titrate it with 0.04 N sulphuric acid till reddish color will appear
3. Note down number of drops or ml added (V2)
4. Open the ffem app and enter the number of drops to get the final reading.

*Total Hardness*
1. Take 25 ml of water sample in 50 ml centrifuge tube, add 1 ml of ammonium buffer
solution and add 3 drops or one small spoon of Eriochrome Black - T indicator
2. Red wine color will develop if hardness is present.
3. Titrate the above red wine color solution till blue color appears.
4. Measure ml (V) of EDTA solution added.
5. Open the ffem app and enter the number of drops to get the final reading.
